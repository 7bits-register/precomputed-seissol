## TPV101-slip
Reference computed on June 22, with commit `115018ad`.

## TPV104

## TPV105
Reference computed on June 22, with commit `115018ad`.

## TPV33
Reference computed on June 9, with commit `2eaf426b`.

Note: This is not the SCEC TPV33, but a test for SeisSol's friction law 33 (imposed slip rates with regularized yoffe STF).

## TPV34
Reference computed on June 9, with commit `2eaf426b`.

Note: This is not the SCEC TPV33, but a test for SeisSol's friction law 34 (imposed slip rates with Gaussian STF).

## TPV5
Reference computed on June 22, with commit `115018ad`.

## ASl vs ASI
On the master branch an output variable is wrongly named `ASI`. As a postprocessing step the variable name has been changed to `ASl`.
